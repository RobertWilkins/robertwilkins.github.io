The test photos for this "test data" inventory page (which includes both samples of photos 
and samples of formatted (HTML) text) were chosen from photos that have been put in the public 
domain by the photographers, from the free photo websites Unsplash and FreeImages.
Thanks are given to the excellent photographers

Most of the photos gathered by these free photo providers are works of art and have very high 
resolution. Extremely large photos are more difficult to use for the purpose of practicing and 
learning with Javascript DRAW, which involves putting smaller boxes inside the original box and
putting photos (or text) into the smaller boxes. Some of these photos have therefore been resized.
I encourage you to contact these excellent artists if you want more artistic work.
These photos are for practicing and learning how to use the DRAW product. Obviously, when you finish
your web page, you want to insert your own photos. You may play around with DRAW by using it directly 
in my web site, without downloading the zip file. To insert your own photos, please read the file 
explain_more1 at my GitHub account.
