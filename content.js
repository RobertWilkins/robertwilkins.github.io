`<h1>Dogs and Cats</h1>
Scientists are working on a research project to discover 
ways for cats and dogs to better get along. So far 
$34.4 million has been spent on this project. House speaker
Kevin McCarthy says this is a colossal waste of taxpayer 
money, and cats and dogs are not supposed to get along anyways 
and this is just another example of how the Democrats are 
destroying the country. 
President Joe Biden said he is not aware of this funding. House
Democrats politely reminded him that the funds were allocated by 
Congress in 2018.`,
