<h1>Introduction To Sample Web Pages </h1>
This page directs you to sample web pages created with the help of the Javascript DRAW tool.
This index page also directs you to other web pages that explain, to non-technical people, how Javascript DRAW works. It is really easy to use.
<br><br>
The very first sample of web pages were created by Javascript DRAW while I was doing early testing, testing putting boxes inside boxes, testing putting photos and text inside boxes, and testing re-setting the margins, borders, and paddings of boxes. These web pages are not supposed to look artistic. What these web pages do show is the available functions of the DRAW tool being shown and tested.
<br>
Some of these pages are not pretty, but are for testing specific features of the tool, like for example, setting the margins, borders, and padding widths for one box, where the page is one box that has been divided into smaller boxes (vertically or horizontally) and each box can be further subdivided into smaller boxes, and photos and text can be put into each box.
<br>
You will note that the pages that involve testing the re-setting of margins & borders & padding (style and widths) look ugly, because I chose settings for margins, borders, paddings that are ridiculously big, just for testing. I'm an inventor and good at tech and math and such. I create tools for artists to use, I'm not an artist myself.
<br>
Some of these pages will try to be more artistic, to show how easily you can create a fairly nice looking web page with this tool.
<br><br>

Again, once you've installed Javascript DRAW (which is just downloading a zip file and opening it up), to get started you just click on page.html, and you start up your web browser with page.html up and running.
The web page is one big starter box. You divide the box into smaller boxes. You can divide the smaller boxes into even smaller boxes. Each time, you choose to divide horizontally or vertically, and each time, you have to specify the widths and maximum-heights, which must add up to the width (or max-height) of the containing box.
For any box that you do not put even smaller boxes in, you can put stuff in the box. That stuff can be images, plain non-formatted text, or regular HTML text (plain text interspersed with HTML tags, for headers, changing font size, and so on).
