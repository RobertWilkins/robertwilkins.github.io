<h1>Welcome, Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Executives</h1>
<br><br><br>


Do you want improved cost-efficiencies and much higher worker productivity for computer programming services for clinical trials?
You've come to the right place. I am at your service. Some options involve machine learning or generative artificial intelligence. Other options (which might be easier to validate) do not require AI at all.

Regardless of whether you wish to explore the AI-enhanced options or the other options, the most important prerequisite for achieving very large improvements in worker productivity is as follows:

<br>
<a href="biotech_dir/page1.html">You have to conduct "workflow experiments" in the right context where workers in these experiments have adequate incentives. (Click here)</a>
<br><br>

This involves running experiments with groups of workers, either your own employees or groups of high school graduates. 

You have MASSIVE worker productivity problems, with statistical table production, with data cleaning, etc.. It is costing you a lot of money.
<br>
YOU CANNOT SOLVE PRODUCTIVITY PROBLEMS WITHOUT CONDUCTING WORKFLOW EXPERIMENTS. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH.
<br><br>
I am also available to help you with short-term priorities, if you have a project with a deadline, I am happy to serve.
(For more information on my background and skill set, contact me, I do have a background in mathematics, statistics, SAS development for clinical trials, using Python-related tools for machine learning. And of course I am an innovator and inventor.)

Oh, one more thing ....
There is currently a software tool available, if you wish to kick the tires, that allows you to create fairly complex statistical tables, very often the table can be produced with less than 30 lines of code (and the code is easy to read and easy to learn), whereas the same table requires over 500 lines of SAS code (meaning labour costs are much higher, and the learning curve for creating tables using SAS is also more difficult). If you have received a letter from me on this issue, and you wish to kick the tires of this tool, please contact me. I should note, if I have a room of properly motivated high school graduates, with above average math grades, they can become competent, I believe, in using this tool for creating fairly complicated statistical tables in a couple of months. Learning to produce such tables using the SAS language probably requires at least two years experience. So it is a question of worker productivity (and therefore labour cost), but it is also a question of the learning curve - who is qualified to do this work.
